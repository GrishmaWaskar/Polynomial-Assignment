 Position Salaries. A Data-Driven Approach using Polynomial Regression 

 # Introduction
 ## Polynomial Regression
-  Polynomial regression is a kind of linear regression in which the relationship shared between the dependent amd independent variables Y and X is modeled as the nth degreee of the polynomial.
Polynomial Regression is the best way of drawing a line using data point.

# Project Overview
- The objective of this project is to predict the salary of a employee by employing Polynomial Regression, The key features considered for analysis include "Position" , "Level" and "Salary".The project encompasses data preprocessing and the development of a predictive model.

# Methodology
## Data Understanding
- Review and understand the dataset, noting the relationships between the features (position, level) and the target variable (salary).

## Data Preparation
- Clean the data, handle any missing values or inconsistencies, and ensure it's ready for analysis.

## Feature Selection
- With only two features (position and level), you might use both as predictors for salary.

## Model Evaluation
- Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics like mean squared error, R-squared, or cross-validation to understand how well the model predicts salaries based on the position and level.

## Prediction
- Once the model is validated, utilize it to predict salaries for new or unseen data points based on the provided position and level features.

 # Results
- The predictive model achieved a significant R-squared (R2) score of 0.9812, indicating a strong relationship between the selected independen variables.
- Predicted salary of  new employee who applied for the role Regional Manager and has a work experience of 2 years and falls under level 6.5 is 133259.47

# Conclusion
  - This conclusion section summarizes the achievements of the polynomial regression model in predicting employee salaries, discusses its accuracy, practical implications, and suggests potential future enhancements to the model.
